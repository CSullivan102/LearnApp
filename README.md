# LearnApp

An app and share extension for organizing your reading list into topics and subtopics.

Notes:

The app expects the LearnKit bundle to contain a Keys.plist file containing developer keys for the Pocket API (https://getpocket.com/developer/). The plist should contain keys `PocketAppId` and `PocketConsumerKey`
